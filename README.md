This is my Gentoo overlay.

It contains currently a custom version of the `cnijfilter` packages (Canon Pixma inkjet printers drivers for CUPS), targetting my personal ip7250 printer, that I archived here after being reviewed by the Gentoo developers (but not accepted at the end, see the [pull request](https://github.com/gentoo/gentoo/pull/5595)).

Thanks to the [@Sabayon](https://github.com/sabayon) project where I sourced initially the packages, and to [@tokiclover](https://github.com/tokiclover) (maintainer of the Bar overlay) who has been supporting the Canon printer topic for several years now.
