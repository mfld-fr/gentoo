This is my Gentoo overlay.

It contains currently a custom version of the `cnijfilter` packages (Canon inkjet printers drivers for CUPS), targetting my personal ip7250 printer, that I archived here after being reviewed by the Gentoo developers (but not accepted at the end, see PR gentoo/gentoo#5595).

Thanks to the Sabayon project where I sourced initially the packages, and to @tokiclover (maintainer of the tokiclover/bar overlay) who has been making a hard work to support the Canon printer topic for several years now.
